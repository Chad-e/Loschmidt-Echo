##Loschmidt Echo

This code produces the plots and results that were published in my paper C. D. Pelwan and I. Snyman
Phys. Rev. B 99, 075432 ? Published 22 February 2019. The paper studies a quantum quench from the strongly correlated ground state of the Kondo model to a Fermi sea and the code is written in Mathematica 12. 

To run the code, data is pulled in from the folder "data", which is preloaded. I have not included the loops that I used to generate the plots from the publication, but these can be added in easily.
